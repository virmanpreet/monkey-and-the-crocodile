once upon a time there lived a gentle crocodile
and on the nearby tree lived a very smart monkey
they were very good freinds everyday the monkey would pluck
some juicy apples for the crocodile in the afternoon the crocodile would swim
to the center of the pond and pick some fishes for the monkey
one the crocodile told his wife about his friend 
she felt greedy and wanted to eat the monkey 
she asked him to invite the monkey for lunch
at their place where she would kill the monkey and eat his heart
the crocodile went to invite the monkey and invited the monkey
to his home . monkey agreed
